#### Coordinating Schedules 
Since we do not have any shared frees as a group, we will try to coordinate times after or before school if needed and also keep in touch through a group chat as opposed to using email only. 

We will also work on using the time we do have together as effectively as possible by identifying things we can work on independently and managing merge conflcits. Outside of time together we will attempt to complete as much as we can on independent pieces of the project to make time together as productive as possible.

Everyone must complete assignments on time and communicate with their team members if they are unable to meet a deadline. \
If someone is not available, we can talk to them separately or get Ms. Feng to discuss. Everyone must follow the guidelines of the team contract.

## Conflicts

Team members should not hesistate to bring their own ideas to the group, but do so in a respectful manner. Active communication and open-mindedness is key to maintaining a good team environment.
